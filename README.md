## React + Vite
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.
Currently, two official plugins are available:
- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


## About Local Setup
After cloing the repo in local, commands to use are listed below:
- npm install
- npm run dev

local app serves at http://localhost:5173/

## About this little application
- I named this application as - `LIST`
- We can create any `LIST` and manage the items.
- `LIST` samples are listed here: (yeah, `listed` here :) )
  - `To Do` list (100% makes the day),
  - `Shopping` list (in weekends),
  - List to note `income/expense` amounts (day-to-day life),
  - `Movies` list (favourites or list to watch),
  - `Grocery` list (day-to-day life),
  - `Meeting Notes` (in office/community meetings),
  <!-- - `Ideas` for person project (I am using currently), -->
  can be listed further if `LIST` is applicable anywhere in our life.



*Okay...*

## My Learnings
- To get REACT handson
- Create, Read, Update, Delete (CURD) operations using the local storage concept of the browser.
- To start with CSS in providing a decent look & the maximum responsive page which I can understand & implement.
